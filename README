Snippets is a process that has been used internally at Google for team communication and collaboration. 
It was developed to address the familiar problem that, for a team to work together effectively, members 
need to keep up-to-date with what everyone else is working on. Rather than handling this problem with 
long meetings or micromanagement, Snippets takes a different approach. Every Sunday, an email is sent 
out to all team members asking them to reply with a bullet list summarizing what they did last week 
and what they plan to work on in the current week. These lists, termed snippets, are automatically 
compiled and emailed out the following day to the entire team. The snippets are also saved to a 
database that anyone on the team can browse using a web app. The result is that any team member can 
quickly get a general overview of what's going on, such as a project's status or what others are doing, 
without disrupting flow.
