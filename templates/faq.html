<ul class="simple"><li>What Are Snippets?</li></ul>
<table><tr><td><div style="width: 35px"></div></td><td align=justify>
Snippets is a process that has been used internally at Google for team communication and collaboration. It was developed to address the familiar problem that, for a team to work together effectively, members need to keep up-to-date with what everyone else is working on.
Rather than handling this problem with long meetings or micromanagement, Snippets takes a different approach. An email is sent out to all team members asking them to reply with a bullet list summarizing what they did and what they plan to work on. These lists, termed snippets, are automatically compiled and emailed out to the entire team. The snippets are also saved to a database that anyone on the team can browse using a web app. The result is that any team member can quickly get a general overview of what's going on, such as a project's status or what others are doing, without disrupting flow.

<ul class="simple"><li>Looks like I don't need to use this web UI that often, right?</li></ul>
<table><tr><td><div style="width: 35px"></div></td><td align=justify>
On very first login you will be automatically enerted into the system. After that you can work completely off reminder and digest emails. 
Web UI will allow you to 'follow' and 'unfollow' users and groups, browser snippet archive, and change your preferences.

<ul class="simple"><li>When I will receive reminder and digest emails?</li></ul>

If you are on the daily snippet schedule, remider will be sent out towards the end of the day and digest in the morning of the following day.<br>
For the weekly schedule, Friday evening is reminder time and following Monday morning is the digest time.

<ul class="simple"><li>How do I control what I get in Snippet Digest?</li></ul>
<table><tr><td><div style="width: 35px"></div></td><td align=justify>
You receive snippets from users you are following and all users from a group you are following. You can control what you want to receive by 'following' or 'unfollowing' users or groups. You can always read all snippets from the web UI.

<ul class="simple"><li>Do I have to reply to specific reminder email for all this to work?</li></ul>
<table><tr><td><div style="width: 35px"></div></td><td align=justify>
No. You can send your snippets directly to the 
<a class="light" href="mailto:snippets@noted-tesla-574.appspotmail.com?Subject=snippet%20time" target="_top">snippet alias</a>
and system will take care of the rest. Replying to a remider email is convenience and gives you a better idea of snippet date.

Yes you can. Reply to any reminder email and change the date in the subject line to match the date you want to backfill for. If you are on weekly snippet schedule make sure you pick the Monday you are submitting snippets for.
